### PhD ###

My PhD thesis in Computer Science was titled _Algorithms for Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis_ and will be freely available for download from the [institutional repository](http://boa.unimib.it).  
Notice that the content has been submitted to international conferences and accepted for publication.

During the first year of my PhD I worked on the design of a computational model for the identification of Structural Variations between genomes using Next-Generation Sequencing data (short reads and paired-ends). The first year presentation of my PhD activity is available [here](./data/Presentation_1st_year.pdf).

During the second year I started working on the realization of an algorithm for the characterization of alternative splicing events of genes, using RNA-seq data. More specifically, I defined a graph structure (called splicing graph) for the representation of a gene structure and the conditions for the correct reconstruction of such a structure from RNA-seq data. Moreover, I designed and implemented an algorithm for constructing the splicing graph. The second year presentation of my PhD activity is available [here](./data/Presentation_2nd_year.pdf).

During the third year I started also working on metagenomic analysis. From April to July 2012 I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [software deparment (LSI)](http://www.lsi.upc.edu/) of the [Technical University of Catalonia (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu) in Barcelona, Spain. I worked on the realization of algorithms for the taxonomic assignments of NGS reads, coming from a metagenomic sample. The third year presentation I held for the admission to the final exam is available [here](./data/Presentation_3rd_year.pdf).

In July 2011 I attended the [Lipari School on BioInformatics and Computational Biology](http://lipari.cs.unict.it/LipariSchool/Bio/previousedition/edition2011bio.htm) on Biological Sequence Analysis and High Throughput Technologies.

* [RNA-seq Graph Builder](http://algolab.github.com/RNA-seq-Graph/)  
RNA-seq Graph Builder is a method to reconstruct the Isoform Graph of a gene from RNA-seq data, without the genome information, where such a graph is a representation of the variants of alternative splicing of the gene structure.

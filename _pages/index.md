My research activity regards Algorithms and it is focused on Bioinformatic problems. My main interests are in the design and development of combinatorial algorithms, with particular attention at biological problems. I work on the study and the realization of applications for biological sequences analysis. I am also interested in the study of computational complexity.

A detailed overview of my scientific activities is provided in my [Curriculum Vitae (English).](/assets/files/CV-Beretta-Stefano.pdf)

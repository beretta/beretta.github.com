* [BAR-seq](https://bitbucket.org/bereste/bar-seq)   
Repository of the software for the analysis of Homology-Directed Repair barcoded cells. An online version is available at [http://www.bioinfotiget.it/barseq](http://www.bioinfotiget.it/barseq).

* [RNA-seq Graph Builder](http://algolab.github.com/RNA-seq-Graph/)   
RNA-seq Graph Builder is a method to reconstruct the Isoform Graph of a gene from RNA-seq data, without the genome information, where such a graph is a representation of the variants of alternative splicing of the gene structure.
